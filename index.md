I'm Josip, currently I work in [Zalando](http://zalando.com), a Berlin-based fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company, on hybrid and neural information retrieval, interactive search and information retrieval evaluation in e-commerce using multi-modal large language models. 

I am also interested to learn about biology and material science, especially about applications of generative models e.g. autoregressive generative models for design of sequences that define objects (e.g. ligands, proteins, RNAs, materials) that perform differnt functions (e.g. bind to proteins) or have different properties (e.g. conductivity) due to their 3D shape or crystal lattice structure that is defined by their chemical composition and physical forces. From machine learning side I'm interested in encoding different structures into objects and learning mappings between these objects from data and physical constraitns.

I'm particularly interested in de novo design of sequences that describe objects and processes that result in objects that perform a specific function or have a specific property.
