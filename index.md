I'm Josip, currently I work in [Zalando](http://zalando.com), a Berlin-based fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company, on search, working both on hybrid and neural information retrieval, interactive search and use of multi-modal large language models for information retreival evaluation in e-commerce. 

I am also interested to learn about biology and material science, especially about applications of generative models e.g. autoregressive generative models for design of sequences that define objects (e.g. ligands, proteins, RNAs, materials) that perform differnt functions (e.g. bind to proteins) or have different properties (e.g. conductivity) due to their shape or physical structure that is defined by their chemical composition and physical forces. From machine learning side I'm interested in encoding different structures into objects and learning mappings between these objects from data and physical constraitns.

I'm particularly interested in de novo design of sequences that describe objects and processes that result in objects that perform specific function or have specific property.
