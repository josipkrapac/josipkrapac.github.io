I'm Josip, I did PhD 10+ years ago in computer vision and work in the industry from 2017. From 2019 I work in Zalando, a fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company, in various departments: research, NLP and most recently in search, working both on neural information retrieval, interactive search powered by LLMs and use of multi-modal LLMs for information retreival evaluation in e-commerce. 

Around a year ago I got interested in biology and material science. I'm learning about applications of generative models like autoregressive generative models for design of sequences that define objects (ligands, proteins, RNAs, materials) that perform differnt functions (e.g. bind to proteins) or have different properties (e.g. conductivity) due to their shape that is defined by their composition and physical forces. In general I'm interested in encoding different structures into objects and learning mappings between these objects from data and known physical constraitns or preferences.

I'm particularly interested in de novo design of sequences, starting from the function, to shape, and to sequence[^1].
