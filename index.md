I'm Josip, I did PhD 10+ years ago and work in "the industry" from 2017. From 2019 I work in Zalando, a fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company, in various departments: research, NLP and most recently in search, working both on neural information retrieval and interactive search powered by LLMs. 

Around a year ago I started to be interested in biology, and applications of machine learning in biology, especially applications of generative models, like autoregressive generative models for design of sequences that result in different functions.
