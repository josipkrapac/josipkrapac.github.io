Hi! I'm Josip, I work in [Zalando](http://zalando.com), a Berlin-based fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company, and Europe's biggest fashion online retailer. I work on hybrid and neural information retrieval, interactive search and information retrieval evaluation in e-commerce using multi-modal large language models. 

I am also interested to learn about biology and material science, especially about applications of generative models e.g. autoregressive generative models for design of sequences that define objects (e.g. ligands, proteins, RNAs, materials) that behave in a some desired way, e g. perform a certain function (e.g. bind to proteins) or have a certain property (e.g. conductivity). The objects' behavior is determined by its structure e.g. 3D shape of folded proteins or crystal lattice structure of materials. This structure is defined by their chemical composition and physical forces.

From machine learning side I'm interested in encoding different kinds of objects objects so they can be virtually manipulated using mappings learned from data and constraints determined by physical laws.
