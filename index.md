Hi! I'm Josip, I work in [Zalando](http://zalando.com), a Berlin-based fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company, and Europe's biggest fashion online retailer. I work on hybrid and neural information retrieval, interactive search and information retrieval evaluation in e-commerce using multi-modal large language models. 

I am also interested to learn about biology and material science, especially about applications of generative models e.g. autoregressive generative models for design of sequences that define objects (e.g. ligands, proteins, RNAs, materials) that behave in a some desired way, e g. perform a certain function (e.g. bind to proteins) or have a certain property (e.g. conductivity). The objects' behavior is determined by its structure (e.g. 3D shape of folded proteins or crystal lattice structure of materials) and the structure is defined by the chemical composition and physical laws. We can use train machine learning models to capture the composition-structure-properties mapping, so we can explore the space of sequences to find the ones that give rise to objects with the desired structure and behavior. 

From machine learning side I'm interested in representing different kinds of objects in a way that allows for virtual manipulation using mappings learned from data and constraints determined by physical laws.
