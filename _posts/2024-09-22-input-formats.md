## Data acquisition
## Data formats
- [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Molecular_Input_Line_Entry_System) used for representig molecules
- [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) used for representing amino-acid or nucleotide sequences
- The rest start from [here](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-file-formats-are-used-for-3c.x9TLBS_abC0Wm6hN7aQ)

## Tasks
### Structure and properties prediction
Best results are obtained using quantum mechanical simulations, which capture the problem at the level of atoms, but these are slow. The goal of this group of methods is to achieve result as close possible to more precise ones, by employing ML methods that are orders of magnitude faster.
### Sequence / composition design
#### Rational design
#### Directed evolution
